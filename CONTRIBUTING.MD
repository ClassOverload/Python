# Contributing
Any code is acceptable as long as it:
- is written exclusively in Python
- is fully functional
- is not profane or otherwise inappropriate
- is not platform-dependent
- is a library (ie., functions, classes, and variables made for the convenience of other programmers)
- has a common topic, like complex numbers, code testing, or logistics

By contributing any code to this repository, you agree to place it under The Unlicense.

# Code we want
Any libraries that deal with common scenarios or represent common real-world objects are desired.

We also welcome any libraries that implement broader numerical representations (like complex numbers, Infinity, or numbers with different bases).
